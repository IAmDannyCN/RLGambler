## Game Rule
Player and dealer each has 5 dices, each dice gives out a point from 1 to 6. The two dices are randomly rolled at the beginning, and two players take turns to re-roll some of his own dices. The game runs by 2 turns, starting from the Player. One who end up with a higher rank of dice distribution wins (see rank at ./score_table.txt)
